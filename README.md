# C- Programming Basics - Lab 1 (22/08/2023)

# Q1) Write a simple Hello World program and its development process

# Theory
The compilation is the process of converting the source code of the C language into machine code. As C is a mid-level language, it needs a compiler to convert it into an executable code so that the program can be run on our machine.
A compiler converts a C program into an executable. There are four phases for a C program to become an executable: 

1. Pre-processing
2. Compilation
3. Assembly
4. Linking
